Javascript Screen Saver
=======================

For this exercise, you will make a page with an image that floats around the screen, similar to the old screensavers.
This involves a) finding the element that you want to move, b) moving it (probably by 1px up and 1px over), and c) repeating step b) forever.

You will make two versions of the screensaver. The first will be written with [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), and will use imperative manipulation of the DOM.  The second will be written as an [Angular JS](http://angularjs.org/) Directive.

Some documentation that will probably be helpful:
* [jQuery selectors API](http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/)
* [setTimeout()](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_settimeout.asp)
* [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)
* [AngularJS Directives](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive)
